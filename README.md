###ARDUINO Matrix App

A open-source project, ARDUINO Matrix App allows bicycle riders control LED matrix attached at the back of the bike with a Web application.

The application allows to communicate basic things to drivers behind cyclists. Message as they are turning left or right, stopping, slowing down or saying THANK YOU!

The project also allows to display any text message on the LED matrix board!! How cool is this?!

Made with love .. and JS.



###Matrix App is powered by Socket.io to control an Arduino LED Matrix using Johnny-Five.
For this project I used:

* Arduino Uno - is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P --> https://www.arduino.cc
* Firmata Library - is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer
* Johnny-Five.js - an awesome JavaScript framework to control Robots
* Socket.io - Library to send events to the server through the browser
